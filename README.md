[Open the website](https://neothunderism.pages.dev) or [download the Windows app](https://github.com/Leo-TY-H/wt-em-calc/releases/latest/download/neothunderism-windows-x64.zip).

On the website, add aircraft, choose flight conditions, and click **Calculate diagram**. Hover over the plot to inspect results; use the download buttons to save charts or data.

The **Missile simulator** tab accepts independent 3D position, velocity and orientation for the missile and target. It plots the engagement, supports timeline playback and exports JSON. The target follows constant velocity; ideal visibility and radar support retain geometric seeker and flight limits. The model is experimental, and a point-proximity event does not assert aircraft damage.

For Windows 10/11 x64:

1. Extract the entire Windows ZIP into a writable folder.
2. Run **Launch EM Plotter.cmd** or **Launch Altitude Plotter.cmd**. Keep its console window open while using the app.
3. Launchers open using bundled data without checking for updates or requiring internet access. Run **Update Game Data.cmd** to refresh aircraft data when GitHub is accessible.

No Python installation is needed. To update the app, close it and extract the new download into a new folder.
